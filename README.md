In this module, I gained practical experience in front-end web development by building a single static portfolio webpage for a client of ABC Consultant, a fictional placement company helping early-career professionals find industry opportunities.

ðŸš€ Key Skills and Concepts Learned:
HTML: Edited and corrected markup errors, ensuring proper structure and semantic usage.

CSS: Enhanced the visual appearance and layout of the webpage to create a polished and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: Wrote functional JavaScript to implement a Simple Interest Calculator, reinforcing basic programming and DOM manipulation skills.

Testing: Verified the functionality of all components to ensure a seamless user experience.

Peer Evaluation: Reviewed and provided constructive feedback on peers' web applications using a structured rubric and grading scheme.

This project allowed me to integrate and apply core web technologies to deliver a clean, functional, and professional portfolio webpage.# module-6
